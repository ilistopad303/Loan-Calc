# Loan-Calc
### This is a personal project meant to take users inputs such as loan amounts, interest rates, payments, etc. and show comparisons with different payments and how much in interest you will be paying
### We will see where this goes, Eventually I want a frontend that can take a form and spit out a graph and such
